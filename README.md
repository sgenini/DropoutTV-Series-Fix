# DropoutTV-Series-Fix
I created this small quality-of-life extension simply because it annoyed me that every time I wanted to navigate to the 'Series' section of Dropout.tv, it would open up a new tab instead of utilizing the same window. All this extension does is modify the target attribute for that link in the navigation.

I don't anticipate needing to update this, but if for whatever reason issues arise, feel free to leave a comment and I'll do some digging.

# Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository or download and extract the ZIP file.
2. Navigate to "[chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)" in your Chrome Browser.
3. Enable 'Developer mode' in the top-right corner.
4. Click "Load unpacked" in the top-left corner.
5. Select the newly created directory containing the extension files and accept.
6. Presto, you're good to go.

Now, upon visiting dropout.tv, the 'Series' link in the navigation will no longer open up in a new tab. 
Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.

Enjoy!

Spring break, I believe in you.
