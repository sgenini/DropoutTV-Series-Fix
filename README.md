# DropoutTV-Series-Fix
I created this small quality-of-life extension simply because it annoyed me that every time I wanted to navigate to the 'Series' section of Dropout.tv, it would open up a new tab instead of utilizing the same window. All this extension does is modify the target attribute for that link in the navigation.

I don't anticipate needing to update this, but if for whatever reason issues arise, feel free to leave a comment and I'll do some digging.
